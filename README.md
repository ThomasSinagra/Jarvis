# JARVIS #

Hey, I'm glad to present you one of my little code : I created a personal assistant, it's named JARVIS, like Iron Man AI
Actually JARVIS speak french, I will probably add more languages in 2025
Before adding other languages, I will make JARVIS more intelligent, I hope that I can link it to some services like Spotify or Google



# Actual version #

Actually, JARVIS is on the 1.0.0.1 version, he can't run on a random machine, you will need to download some external tools like :
- Python 3.11
- Pip
- Some python librairy
Actually I'm working on making it more intelligent, I will make it capable of running in every PC in some month

# About JARVIS #

JARVIS is actualy capable of :
- Understand when you call him
- Save what you just copied
- Put your @mail on your clipboard
- Open some application (Only on MacOS)

# About the future of JARVIS #

JARVIS is a personal project so I don't work on it very often, it's not my principal project
